REMOVE todo.txt?

GIT!!!!

Redesign: interface "gamestate"(?) with show function for easier return when exiting menu (e.g. inventory)

Check todos in code
Error messages (Assignment)
add more monsters and items
implement random dungeon if bonus tasks running

When resetting player --> reset to base stats

on inventory change --> update stats of player (passive effects) 
	-->	not working when removing, as every object in inventory is the same, so more than one item gets removed. Better use indices or copies of objects.
		But can't really use indices, as user just inputs name of object. better just find the first appearance of the item?
refactor!!!! --> especially text_messages (how to store text most effectively?, item list)
